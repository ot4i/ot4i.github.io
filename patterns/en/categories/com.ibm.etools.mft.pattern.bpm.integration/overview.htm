	<h2 class="sectiontitle">The context</h2>
	<p>IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) provides enterprise level business process design and modeling, 
	and IBM Integration Bus provides enterprise strength connectivity and integration.</p>

<div class="section">
	<h2 class="sectiontitle">The problem</h2>
	<p>When a business analyst develops a business process design (BPD) by using IBM BPM they might require some 
	business data that is available from a corporate service. The owner of the corporate service can tell  
	the business analyst what information must be supplied to retrieve the required business data.</p>
  
	<p>The business analyst knows how to define the input and output business objects required for the BPD 
	but does not know how to configure the connectivity to the corporate service. For example, 
	the corporate service might use a specific transport type, might supply more data than is required, 
	or might require security or adherence to a specific quality of service.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
	<h2 class="sectiontitle">Selection guidance</h2>
	<p>Use this pattern when an IBM BPM user has defined an interface in a BPM integration service and that 
	interface must be implemented by using an IBM Integration Bus service.</p>
